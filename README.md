This assignment is from my first day of learning CSS with The Odin Project.
The topics covered in the assignment were external vs. internal CSS, class and id selectors,
grouping and chaining selectors, descendent combinator, and cascade.  Throughout the assignment

many of the common git functions on the command line (add, commit, push, status, log).
