This assignment is from my first day of learning CSS with The Odin Project.
The topics covered in the assignment were external vs. internal CSS, class and id selectors,
grouping and chaining selectors, descendent combinator, and cascade.  Throughout the assignment
I also got a lot of practice with adding and committing changes to git.  I am comfortable now with 
many of the common git functions on the command line (add, commit, push, status, log).
